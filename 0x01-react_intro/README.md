This project is part of the curriculum of ALX Africa. It serves as an introduction to React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Topics Covered

1. **Creating a Basic JavaScript Application Using React**: This project will guide you through the process of setting up a basic React application from scratch.

2. **Using create-react-app**: To start developing quickly with React, we'll be using `create-react-app`, a tool that sets up a new React project with sensible defaults and best practices.

3. **Understanding and Using JSX**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is used with React to describe what the UI should look like. We'll dive into how to use JSX in your React applications.

4. **Debugging with React Developer Tools**: Debugging is an essential skill for any developer. This project will show you how to use the React Developer Tools to debug your code effectively.

5. **Testing with Enzyme's Shadow Rendering**: Testing is a crucial part of software development. In this project, we'll use Enzyme's shadow rendering to test our application.

6. **Using React with Webpack & Babel**: Webpack is a module bundler, while Babel is a JavaScript compiler. We'll learn how to use these tools in conjunction with React to build and optimize our application.
